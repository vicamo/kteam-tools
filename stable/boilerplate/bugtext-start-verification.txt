This bug is awaiting verification that the _PACKAGE_/_VERSION_ kernel in -proposed solves the problem. Please test the kernel and update this bug with the results. If the problem is solved, change the tag 'verification-needed-_SERIES_-_PACKAGE_' to 'verification-done-_SERIES_-_PACKAGE_'. If the problem still exists, change the tag 'verification-needed-_SERIES_-_PACKAGE_' to 'verification-failed-_SERIES_-_PACKAGE_'.

If verification is not done by 5 working days from today, this fix will be dropped from the source code, and this bug will be closed.

See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed for documentation how to enable and use -proposed. Thank you!
