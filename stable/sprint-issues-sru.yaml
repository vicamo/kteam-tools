          description: 'Bugs tagged `kqa-blocker` and the current SRU cycle tag (i.e. `sru-YYYYMMDD`), will get added to this list by a cron job. These bugs should be reviewed to determine if they identify a regression that needs to be fixed before kernel release, can be deferred to a future cycle, needs a test fix, or something else. As bugs are reviewed and an action is determined, they should be moved to other lists. If the bug is determined not to be a blocker, the `kqa-blocker` tag can be removed.'
