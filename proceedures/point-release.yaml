  - name: "Pick point release kernel cut over cycle and announce"
    description: |
      - Pick a likely last SRU cycle to hit the point release image, this
        should be two cycles before the point release.
      - announce to kernel-team@ mailing list etc
    prerequisites:
    - "Identify formal release date"

      - Create sub-tasks on Each "linux-*" issue for
        all kernels which will be rolled at the point release.
  - name: "Review linux-*-edge testing"
    description: |
      - Once kernels are rolled review ADT testing for those and create
        cards to fix any issues found.
    prerequisites:
      - "Identify kernels to be rolled with the point release"
  - name: "Update firmware package for HWE kernel migration"
    description: |
      - When a new HWE kernel is rolled out, the linux-firmware package
        needs to be updated to include the firmware blobs to match. Ideally
        this needs to be done before the point release is out so it gets
        included in the installation media.
  - name: "Sync with Certification Team"
    description: |
      - Notify the Certification Team as soon as possible about a new HWE kernel
        being prepared to allow them to plan for the certification tests on
        time.
  - name: "Roll linux-*-edge to point release version"
    description: |
      - Prepare and upload updates to the linux-*-edge package moving it
        to the release kernel base version as soon as the primary series
        kernel reaches the final version.
    prerequisites:
      - "Identify kernels to be rolled with the point release"
      - "Pick point release kernel cut over cycle and announce"

      - Review all of the ADT and upgrade testing and approve rolls
  - name: "Roll linux-*-edge to linux-* package"
    description: |
      - Update the variants of the linux-*-edge package to '-*' so the
        meta and lrm packages will start producing the final variant and
        replace the older ones.
      - Note: we need to confirm testing and have stakeholder-signoff for
        these.
