cards:
  - name: "Test Secure Boot"
    description: |
      - Test Secure Boot on all supported architectures (amd64, arm64, ppc64el, s390x)
  - name: "Verify variants"
    description: |
      - Verify whether the variants (e.g. '--', 'lts', 'hwe', 'hwe-edge') are setup
        correct in kernel-series.yaml and in the meta and lrm packages.
  - name: "Fix DKMS packages"
    description: |
      - Fix all the DKMS packages which are failing the build or tests with the

      - Create a sub-task for each DKMS package that needs fixing.
  - name: "Make sure all DKMS packages are really tested"
    description: |
      - On ADT, the "dkms" package is responsible for installing and building
        the DKMS packages that don't explicitly define autopkgtests. There were
        issues in the past where the "dkms" package reported "pass" even when
        the DKMS packages were not built.
      - This task is to make sure all the DKMS tests are reviewed and there are
        not false positives.
  - name: "Remove all dead DKMS packages from the archive"
