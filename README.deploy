Deployment
----------
In order to use the contained scripting some additional external
dependencies are required.  To fetch and attache these dependencies run
the deploy script:

    ./deploy

This will clone any external repositories and link any libraries into
the consuming tools.

Currently this fetches and installs the following dependencies:

1) python-jira -- used to interact with the JIRA API.  This is used
   by kernel-various swm related tools.
2) python-mattermost-driver -- used to interact with Mattermost.
