# Configuration file for the cranky toolchain.

# Copy to ~/.cranky or ~/.cranky.yaml and modify as you like. Note that a
# configuration file is not necessary since all options can also be specified
# using commandline arguments. Commandline arguments take precedence over
# options specified in this file.

# Absolute base path for all the bits managed by the cranky tools. The repos,
# logs, ...
#
# All paths below are relative to this 'base-path':
#
base-path: '~/canonical/kernel/ubuntu'

# cranky-checkout
#checkout:
  # A local reference kernel repo used for cloning the Ubuntu kernel repo.
  # Using this speeds up the cloning process considerably. See
  # 'git help clone', option --reference, for more details.
  #reference: /path/to/local/kernel/repo
  # Borrow the objects from the above reference repo only during the cloning
  # process to reduce network traffic. See 'git help clone', option
  # --dissociate, for more details.
  #dissociate: True

# cranky-test-build
#test-build:
  # The directory where the logfiles are written to
  #logdir: /path/to/logdir

# Path to source code directories
#
# The relative paths to the git repos of the different packages. The paths can
# be specified per package type (main, meta, signed) or via a 'default' entry
# which is used as a fallback. The following formatter keywords are
# recognized:
#   {series}:      The distro series codename (bionic, ...)
#   {type}:        The type of the package (main, meta, signed, ...)
#   {type_suffix}: The suffix of dependent packages (-meta, -signed, ...)
#   {package}:     The package name (linux, linux-aws, linux-meta-gcp, ...)
#
# The following configuration assumes you are going to use the following
# layout:
#
#  $HOME/canonical/kernel/ubuntu/<ubuntu_release>/<kernel_version>
#
package-path:
  default: '{series}/linux{type_suffix}'
